# Advent-of-Code
My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## 2017
For 2017, I've decided to try my hand at Elixir. Going in, I have very little experience with the language, but it interests me, and I'm looking to get more practice with functional programming.

## 2020
For 2020 I opted for C# using .Net core. Even though I was quite familiar with C#, I hadn't had much experience with .Net core and I wanted a reason to try it out. That includes new C# features that have been added in recent versions of the language, so there were still things to learn.

## 2021
I had recently begun learning Python, and this was a great chance to get some more experience with it.
